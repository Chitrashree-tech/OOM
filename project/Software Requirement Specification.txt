Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
Cloud-Based File Storage & Sharing System
1. Introduction:
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the software requirements for the Cloud-Based File Storage & Sharing System. This SRS outlines the functional and non-functional specifications of the system, providing a clear understanding of its goals, architecture, and design constraints. The document serves as a guideline for developers, project managers, testers, and stakeholders involved in the project.


1.2 Document Conventions
This document follows the IEEE Standard for Software Requirements Specifications (IEEE 830). The terms “shall” indicate mandatory requirements, while “should” indicates optional or recommended features. All diagrams are represented using Mermaid UML syntax for clarity and portability.


1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
This SRS is intended for:
Developers – To understand detailed functional requirements and design constraints.
Project Managers – To plan, schedule, and track the project development.
Testers – To design and perform validation and verification procedures.
Clients/End Users – To understand the capabilities and limitations of the system. It is suggested that readers review Sections 1 and 2 for an overview, followed by Section 3 for detailed system functionality.


1.4 Product Scope
The Cloud-Based File Storage & Sharing System is designed to allow users to securely store, access, and share files via a web-based and mobile platform. It enables functionalities such as file upload/download, sharing via links or user permissions, version control, and real-time synchronization. The system aims to enhance collaboration and data availability while maintaining data security and integrity.

2. Overall Description:
2.1 Product Perspective
The Cloud-Based File Storage & Sharing System operates as a distributed, client-server architecture hosted on a cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP). The system will include both a web interface and mobile application, communicating with backend APIs for authentication, data management, and file storage.


2.2 Product Features
User Authentication and Authorization: Secure login, registration, and role-based access control.
File Management: Upload, download, rename, delete, and organize files and folders.
Sharing and Collaboration: Share files with specific users or generate public/private shareable links.
Version Control: Maintain file history and revert to previous versions.
Search and Filtering: Locate files quickly using search keywords, filters, or tags.
Storage Analytics: Display usage statistics and storage capacity reports.
Backup and Recovery: Automated cloud backups with recovery options.


2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
End User – Uploads, downloads, and shares files using a simple, user-friendly interface.
Administrator – Manages users, permissions, and overall storage operations.
System Developer – Develops and maintains the system’s backend and frontend components.
Tester – Validates system functionality and ensures quality through testing.


2.4 Operating Environment
Server: Cloud-hosted environment (AWS EC2, Azure VM, or GCP Compute Engine)
Client: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari), Android/iOS apps
Database: MySQL or PostgreSQL for metadata; Cloud object storage for files
Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, macOS


2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
Must comply with cloud provider APIs (e.g., AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
Implementation languages: Java/Spring Boot for backend, React/Flutter for frontend.
Follow REST API standards for interoperability.
Use encryption standards (AES-256 for data, TLS 1.3 for communication).


2.6 User Documentation
Online help section integrated into the app.
User manual with setup and troubleshooting guides
Administrator guide for managing user accounts and permissions.


2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
Users must have stable internet connectivity.
The system depends on third-party cloud service uptime (e.g., AWS or Google Cloud).
Browser and device compatibility as per supported versions.


3. System Features
3.1 Functional Requirements
User Registration & Login – Allows users to register and securely authenticate using email, password, and token-based authentication (JWT/OAuth 2.0).
File Upload and Storage – Enables users to upload files to cloud storage while saving related metadata like name, size, and owner.
File Sharing – Allows users to share files through permissions or shareable links, with options to revoke access anytime.
File Download and Access Control – Permits only authorized users to download files, maintaining detailed audit logs of al download events.
Version Control and History – Maintains file version history and allows users to restore previous versions when needed.
Search and Organization – Supports file search by name, type, or tags and provides folder-based hierarchical organization.


3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Security: Data encryption at rest and in transit.
Scalability: Support at least 10,000 concurrent users.
Performance: Response time under 2 seconds for all major operations.
Availability: 99.9% uptime SLA.
Reliability: Automatic recovery from failures within 5 minutes.
Usability: User-friendly UI with consistent design across devices.
Maintainability: Modular code structure with proper documentation.
Portability: Compatible with major browsers and OS.


3.3 Domain Requirements
Compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
Support for role-based access control (Admin, User, Viewer).
All files stored with unique identifiers for deduplication.


3.4 External Interface Requirements
User Interface: Responsive web dashboard and mobile app.
Hardware Interface: Standard input devices and mobile touchscreens.
Software Interface: Integration with Google Drive, Dropbox APIs.
Communication Interface: REST API over HTTPS.
