Cloud-Based File Storage & Sharing System
Project Description:
The Cloud-Based File Storage & Sharing System is a secure and scalable web application that enables users to store, access, and share files online from anywhere at any time. Built with a focus on data security, accessibility, and collaboration, the system allows users to upload, download, and organize files in a cloud environment with support for file versioning and role-based access control.
Users can share files through shareable links or user-specific permissions, ensuring controlled access and privacy. The system also includes features such as real-time synchronization, search and filtering, and automated backups, making it suitable for both personal and organizational use.
The backend integrates cloud APIs such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage for reliable data management, while authentication and authorization are handled through JWT/OAuth 2.0 for maximum security.

Key Features:
Secure user registration and authentication
File upload, download, and version management
File sharing with permission-based access
Real-time search and file organization
Encrypted storage and communication (AES-256, TLS 1.3)
Cross-platform access via web and mobile
Cloud backup and recovery support

Tech Stack:
